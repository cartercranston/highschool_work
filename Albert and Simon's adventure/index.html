	  <p>Use the arrow keys to move your sphere around.
	  <br>You can't go through asteroid belts, forcefields or planets.
	  <br>If you get hit by a ship or photon torpedo, you lose.
	  <br>To win a level, you must first get adjacent to the planet.
	  <br>Your drones will beam down to the planet, and after six seconds you will be allowed to return to the planet.
	  <br>Finally, you will have to return to the cube.
	  <br>Forcefields disappear when you beam your drones up from the planet.</p>
