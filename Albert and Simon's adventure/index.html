	  <p>Use the arrow keys to move the sphere around.
	  <br>We can't go through asteroid belts, forcefields or planets.
	  <br>If we get hit by a ship or photon torpedo, we lose.
	  <br>Winning a level takes a few steps:
      <br>First, we must first get adjacent to the planet. When we do, the surface will start exploding.
	  <br>After six seconds, the explosions will stop, and we must return to the planet. Once we do, the forcefields will all disappear.
	  <br>Finally, we must return to the cube.</p>
